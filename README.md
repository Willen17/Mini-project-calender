# Calendar

## Project made by: Jonatan, Love & William <br>

### Description

In this project we have been given the task of designing and programming an interactive calendar through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The calendar consists of a title and a welcome segment where the user can see time, day of the week and date as well as create and delete to-dos. Furthermore, the calendar displays the days of the current month. If there are any created to-dos, the current date will indicate a to-do with a number. The page is also responsive and on smaller devices it is possible to toggle between the 'welcome segment view' and the 'calendar view'.<br><br>
